        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            We have been providing quality sands to fellow americans since the founding of our company in 1833.<br>
            All of our sand is ethically sourced from the Snake Pits of the Great Basin Desert, surrounding our company headquarters in Utah.
        </p>
        <h4>Our Founder</h4>
        <p>
            Our founder, Nathaniel Dustins, founded Sand Land after discovering the Snake Pits in Utah more than a decade before it became<br>
            an official state of the U.S. Originally, the goal of the company was to capture and sell snakes, but after the Snake Oil Distribution Act of 1852<br>
            Sand Land shifted towards more fruitful ventures: sand.
